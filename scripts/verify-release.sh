# verify-release.sh — gate a release before it is shown to users.
#
# A first-time visitor follows the release's two recommended entry points: the
# one-click desktop installer, and `docker pull` + the documented first-scan
# command. Those artifacts are produced by separate workflows (desktop.yml,
# docker-publish.yml) that finish after the release is created, so this script
# confirms both are actually ready and working for THIS release:
#   1. BomLens-Setup.exe and .dmg are attached to the release.
#   2. The published scanner image for this version is pullable.
#   3. The documented first-scan command produces a valid SBOM on that exact
#      published image (not a CI-built one).
#   4. The three opt-in images (firmware/aibom/deep-cve) are pullable too
#      (checked after step 3, not before -- see that step's own comment).
#
# It only verifies (no publish/side effects), so the release-gate job can run it
# while the release is still a draft, and it can be dry-run on demand against an
# existing tag.
#
# Usage: verify-release.sh <tag>            e.g. verify-release.sh v1.5.1
# Env:   GH_TOKEN          token for `gh` (GITHUB_TOKEN in Actions)
#        VERIFY_TIMEOUT    seconds to wait for the installers and the main
#                          image (default 2100)
#        VERIFY_SECONDARY_TIMEOUT  seconds for the WHOLE step checking the
#                          three opt-in images, shared rather than split three
#                          ways (default 5400 = 90 min): they do not take
#                          equal time to build (measured on a real run:
#                          firmware ~11min, deep-cve ~9min, aibom ~86min, all
#                          starting alongside the main image in the same
#                          docker-publish.yml call, not after it), and this
#                          job has no other way to learn docker-publish.yml
#                          finished -- release-upstream.yml's `release` and
#                          `images` jobs are not ordered by `needs:`, so this
#                          polling loop IS the synchronization. If the
#                          self-hosted runner ever serializes these image
#                          builds instead of running them concurrently, this
#                          default may need to grow again.

#    version. docker-publish.yml's build-firmware/build-aibom/build-deep-cve
#    jobs run unconditionally alongside the main image on a real release, so
#    a broken push for one of them is exactly as release-blocking as the main
#    image being missing -- just harder to notice, since nothing else in this
#    gate ever pulls them. Pull-only, not a full scan: these are large --
#    measured compressed sizes: aibom ~3.8 GB (the biggest of the four
#    images, base included), deep-cve ~0.7 GB (its ~1.8 GB vulnerability DB is
#    built INTO the image, not fetched here), firmware ~0.4 GB -- and each
#    already gets its own Trivy scan inside docker-publish.yml. One shared
#    deadline for all three (see VERIFY_SECONDARY_TIMEOUT above), not a
#    separate budget each: aibom alone measures ~86 minutes to build, so
#    treating it the same as firmware's ~11 or deep-cve's ~9 would either
#    waste time three times over or starve the one that actually needs it.
#    Run AFTER step 3's walkthrough (see that step's comment): by now aibom
#    has had the walkthrough's own ~40-45 minutes of extra build time, so this
#    deadline mostly only needs to cover what remains, not the whole build.
#    Removed after each check, not kept like the main image: nothing later in
#    this script needs them. The main image, by contrast, is kept and tagged
#    :latest above (step 2) precisely so step 3's walkthrough reuses that
#    local copy instead of pulling it again -- these three have no such
#    later reader, so there is nothing to keep them for.
#    Only the bomlens-* names are checked, not the legacy sbom-scanner-*
#    aliases docker-publish.yml also signs: both names tag the exact same
#    DIGEST there, so a pull of one proves the other's manifest is just as
#    reachable, and checking it again here would only spend more of the
#    shared deadline on a second pull of bytes already confirmed present.
