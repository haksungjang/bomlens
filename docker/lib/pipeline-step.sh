# pipeline-step.sh — observability helpers for best-effort post-process steps.
#
# Several post-process steps (normalize, CPE/AIBOM enrichment, conformance,
# vendored-OSS suggestion) must never abort a scan — a valid SBOM is always
# emitted — which is why they used to end in `... || true`. But a bare `|| true`
# hid real failures: a broken step silently produced a slightly wrong SBOM with
# no trace. run_optional_step keeps the "never abort" guarantee while logging the
# failure and recording it on the SBOM, so the failure is observable.
#
# Sourced by docker/entrypoint.sh and, for mark_document_status specifically,
# by enrich-eol.sh / enrich-malicious.sh directly (they run as their own `bash
# script.sh` process, not sourced into entrypoint.sh's shell, so each sources
# this file itself). Unit-tested by tests/test-postprocess.sh.

# Stamp a single-valued document-level status property, replacing any existing
# entry of the same name rather than appending — so re-running the same check,
# or re-scanning an SBOM that already carries this scanner's own stamp (a
# supplier-submitted BomLens SBOM re-processed with --analyze), does not
# accumulate duplicates. Distinct from mark_pipeline_warning below, whose
# entries intentionally form a list (one failed step co-exists with another).
