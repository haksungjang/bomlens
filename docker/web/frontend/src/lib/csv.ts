 * CSV serialisation for the result tables, so a filtered list can be taken into
 * a spreadsheet and turned into a report.

 * Pure and offline: the rows the user is looking at are already in the browser,
 * so nothing is asked of the server and nothing about the scan leaves the
 * machine, which is the same bargain the rest of this tool makes.
 *
 * Quoting follows RFC 4180. It matters more here than in most tables: package
 * names carry commas in their license lists, CVE titles carry quotes, and a
 * description can carry a newline. Any of the three, unescaped, silently shifts
 * every later column of that row into the wrong place — a corrupted report that
 * still opens.
