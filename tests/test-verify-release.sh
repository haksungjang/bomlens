# test-verify-release.sh: No-Docker unit tests for
# scripts/verify-release.sh's check_secondary_image(), the step-3 loop that
# confirms the three opt-in images (firmware/aibom/deep-cve) are pullable at
# a release's version tag.
#
# The rest of verify-release.sh needs a real `gh` CLI, a real network, and a
# 40-minute docs-walkthrough run, so it has no test coverage of its own; this
# function is the one piece cheap enough to lift out and drive against a
# stubbed `docker` on PATH, the same technique test-image-refresh.sh uses for
# scan-sbom.sh's functions.
